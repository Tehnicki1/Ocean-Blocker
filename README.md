# Ocean Blocker 🌊
Tool designed to "block ocean". This tool kills every process containing "ocean" inside the name as soon as it starts. Made to bypass screenshares.

# How to use❓
1. Download the blocker.exe from releases
2. Run it 

# How to close❓
To exit the blocker you need to find a file in process hacker / task manager with a weird name, examples: "SHF76IK1.exe", "7OE2Q2QK.exe", "0EZV2CRD.exe" and kill / terminate it. 
The reason for the weird name is for undetectability. For example, in a pc check they cant just search "blocker.exe" and find it in ur running processes.
